            Now they’re following it up with another live extravaganza, this one recorded at LA’s ornate Mayan Theater.
            Titled Billy D And The Hall Of Feathered Serpents, it will find the band playing their 2015 album Money $hot
            in full. We caught up with Billy D himself – aka a characteristically cagey Maynard – to try and find out
            what
            we can expect from it…
